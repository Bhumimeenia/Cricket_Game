# Cricket_Game
A simple Cricket game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features bat, ball, and stump choices. Players select one option, and the computer randomly picks another, determining a win, loss, or draw. The game displays results, tracks the score, and includes a reset button to clear the score and start fresh.
